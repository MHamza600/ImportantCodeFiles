# Important Code Files
This repository contain some of the code snippets from the projects I did during my bachelors degree. The snippets showcase some important OOP concepts and overall coding conventions.

Starting with OOP concept solving a design problem in which we want to sort object by same command unless what ever the structure of object with different sorting algorithm

So, What a sorting algorithm need , A Comparatore function (To compare two values). So, Inherited Sorting Algorthim(bubble, selection and insertion) from sorting algorithm class and give comapartor function to sort function whenever it is called.

The code of the required solution is in file (Bubble sort , Selection Sort , Insertion sort , comarator, Employee class , Student class , Sorting Algorithm , Sorrtng Assignment)

Another OOP snipet in which I implemented Structure of design pattern chain of responsibility, A user can search on the bassis of Temparature , PMvlaue and Humidity.  So , Temprature Sensor was not available command shifted to Humodity and vice versa

The pattern Implmented in files(byHumidity, bypM , ByTemp , Search , Controller)

A web Scrapper code in which I try to find keywords from webpages in file (Scrapper)

A data is stored in a linklist structure after dycryotion to acheive security purposes in file (LinkList)

A Sample Unity Game Script in file (UnityGameScript)
